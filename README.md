# ciwise.github.io
Organization GitHub Pages Repository

This project is generated as a static website by the project ciwise.github.custom. That Jekyll site uses the "build" command to
send this site to an adjoining directory local called cwise.github.io. Both projects are checked out, the site is updated and the 
build command is run, generating the static site to this project locally. After the web site is tested local, this project and
ciwise.github.custom are both checked in together. This project is available on the URL ciwise.com because of the CNAME file in
the root directory.
