We are hindered today by nothing but our imagination as it relates to computers and technology. Open source continues to provide cookbook solutions 
to almost every imaginable problem encountered in business or home life. The sheer collection of this software is so immense that the reason people 
continue to buy proprietary software is only because they either don't know of the open source solution or think it's inferior. Cost is still a 
factor because open source has a learning curve. Time is money and that's where we come in. An open source enterprise consultant can introduce your 
business to fantastic new technologies that can improve your bottom line. They can lead your development staff into new territory, improving your 
overall development, testing, continuous integration, deployment, and agility. Contact us at david@ciwise.com or call 919-605-6529.
